# snake
Snake game made in javascript.

The snake enlarges by one unit when he eats an apple.
The snake can penetrate the walls and come out from the opposite side but it can not pass through itself.
Eating an apple increases the number of points by a fixed value.
The game consists of five levels, each represented by an increasingly difficult maze.
Each level has a different point multiplier (the more difficult the maze, the more points you can get for apples)
The game has power-ups that appear regularly after a certain number of eaten food.

Power-ups can:
• shorten the snake by X,
• extend the snake by X,
• accelerate the snake for Y seconds,
• slow down the snake for Y seconds,
• add more points (standard number multiplied by X),
• make the snake pass through the elements of the maze for Y seconds.

The player can set the following parameters:
• choose a maze,
• set the time of power-ups Y,
• set the power-up unit X,
• snake speed

The top 5 results are remembered for the duration of the game.
